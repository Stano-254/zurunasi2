                <h4 id="diani">Lamu Island Dhow Safaris</h4>
                <p class="park-content">The waters of Lamu are plied by great numbers of traditional lateen sail Dhows.
                    These craft are an integral part of life on the island. A day spent at sea on a Dhow is a wonderful
                    experience and a fantastic way to explore the area. The calm waters around Lamu are perfect for
                    sailing, and the neighbouring islands are well worth visiting for their small fishing villages,
                    ancient ruins and deserted beaches</p>
                <p class="park-content">After a day on the water, you sail back to Lamu town as the setting sun turns
                    the ocean to gold. Longer Dhow safaris throughout the entire Archipelago can also be arranged. Most
                    hotels and guesthouses, as well as private Dhow captains, can organize a day cruising on a dhow.</p>

                <p class="park-content"> A good excursion for both diving and snorkeling is a day dhow trip to Wasini
                    Island, within the Kisite Mpunguti Marine Reserve- easily arranged from Diani or Shimoni. This
                    usually includes snorkelling and/or diving, and a seafood lunch on the island..</p>
                <p class="park-content">This is makes for a relaxing day trip, with dolphins often accompanying the dhow
                    through the reserve, and the interior of the island itself well worth exploring. .</p>

                <h4 id="bikenaivasha">Mida Creek Boat Trips</h4>
                <p class="park-content"> An ideal way to spend an afternoon in Watamu is to take an organized boat trip
                    into the mangroves and estuaries of Mida Creek. This creek is home to a fantastic range of bird
                    life, and there are countless winding channels and estuaries to explore.

                    These trips can be locally arranged in Watamu..</p>
