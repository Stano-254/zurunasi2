                    popularity of the sport increases, more and more mountain bikes are now for hire, and there is
                    plenty of undiscovered country for bush biking.</p>

                    area and local life. Bicycles can be hired locally all along the coast either from hotels or private
                    operators.</p>

                    National Park. The Park is excellent biking country, and allows the cyclist to ride through herds of
                    plains game..</p>
