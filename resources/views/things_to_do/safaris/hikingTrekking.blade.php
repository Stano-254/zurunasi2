                <p class="park-title"> For the Trekker, Kenya is a world of highs and lows assuming you don’t suffer
                    from muscle conditions like Tetany or hypocalcemia. From the snow capped peak of Mt Kenya to the
                    desert plains of the north. There are a range of treks from sedate hill walks through game rich
                    ranges to high altitude routes on alpine slopes. For those aiming higher, Kenya offers plenty of
                    challenges. Climbers may be aware of the mighty peak of Mt Kenya, but there are many other climbing
                    areas to be explored. There is a broad scope of destinations, from granite cliffs and volcanic rock
                    towers to the ultimate challenge- a technical assault on Africa’s second highest summit.
                    Where.</p>

                <h4 id="mtkenya">Technical Climbing – Mount Kenya</h4>
                <p class="park-content">
                    Mt Kenya is considered the most challenging technical climb in Africa, and attracts experienced
                    climbers from all over the world. Making the summit requires both expert guiding and equipment.
                    While any fit trekker has a good chance of reaching Point Lenana, the ascent to the summit, crested
                    by twin icy peaks called Batian and Nelion is a serious 5.10 technical climb across ice, scree and
                    rock. Climbers should be experienced and prepared and use a reputable guiding company with all
                    required kit provided..</p>

                <h4 id="fisher">Rock Climbing, Fischer’s Tower</h4>
                <p class="park-content"> Hell’s Gate National Park has some of Kenya’s best Rock Climbing. There are
                    high cliffs with several possible routes, and plenty of opportunity for climbs and Abseiling.
                    Fischer’s Tower, a large volcanic pillar, is also a good climb. There is a qualified rock climbing
                    guide based at Hell’s Gate Park HQ (by Elsa gate). Equipment and guiding services can be hired at
                    the Park gate..</p>

                <hr class="makerHr">

                <h4 id="bikenaivasha">Mount Elgon Trekking</h4>
                <p class="park-content"> Mountain Bikes are widely available for hire from Lodges and camps around the
                    Lake. They are a great way to explore the lakeshore and an even better way to explore Hell’s Gate
                    National Park. The Park is excellent biking country, and allows the cyclist to ride through herds of
                    plains game.</p>
                <p class="park-content"> Trekkers should be adequately prepared. Despite its equatorial location the
                    Mountain can be cold, and it often rains. All trekkers should have plenty of warm clothing, and
                    sturdy footwear. There are several established routes on Elgon, but the Mountain lends itself to
                    exploration and free hiking. Local guides and Rangers are your best resource. The cliffs of lower
                    Elgon and Sudek are also good for rock climbing.</p>

                <hr class="makerHr">
                <h4 id="bikenaivasha">Loroghi Hills</h4>
                <p class="park-content">Wild and isolated yet easily accessible, the Loroghi hills are one of Kenya’s
                    best trekking regions. The hills provide stunning views across the Rift Valley, as well as high
                    mountain passes and the cool of deep forested valleys.</p>
                <p class="park-content">Tracks wind their way up the Lesiolo escarpment, reaching a 2580 metre pinnacle
                    at Poror Peak. The real beauty of this region though, is the opportunity to meet and spend time with
                    the Samburu people, for whom these hills are home. Travelling with a Samburu guide helps you to get
                    to know both the land and its people, making your trek more than just a walk..</p>

                <hr class="makerHr">
                <h4 id="bikenaivasha">Wild treks in Aberdare Forest</h4>
                <p class="park-content">This is good country for an adventurous wild trek through the forest with a lot
                    to explore. There is a well marked trail and observation at the beautiful Karuru Falls. From this
                    high vantage there are also excellent views of the entire range and the distant Gura Falls. There
                    are also wooden walkways across the lower Chania falls. If you’re feeling hot, and brave, you may
                    wish to attempt a plunge into the icy waters here..</p>
                <p class="park-content">The lower, densely forested Salient has plenty of game, both big and small. The
                    upper slopes have high moorlands and open plains, which are ideal for walking, rising to a summit of
                    4000 metres at Satima. There are excellent views across to the snow capped peak of Mt Kenya and the
                    surrounding plains. Trekkers should remember that this area can be bitterly cold at night. There are
                    some basic campsites and huts available for trekkers.</p>

                <hr class="makerHr">
                <h4 id="bikenaivasha">Kakamega Forest walks</h4>
                <p class="park-content">The lush forest has many good trails, and the wide variety of unique plants and
                    animals make for an truly fascinating trek. Trekking conditions are quite easy, although one should
                    be prepared for occasional rain.</p>
                <p class="park-content">There are a range of trails and circuits allowing for treks and walks of varying
                    length. The close proximity of good accommodation within the forest provides a good base for
                    exploration. Excellent and fully qualified guides can be hired locally from the rest houses or
                    campsite. These guides have a wealth of local information and can give the visitor a real insight
                    into the forest and its rich diversity. Kakamega is popular with specialist birding and naturalist
                    safaris, who often lead treks through the forest.</p>

                <hr class="makerHr">
                <h4 id="bikenaivasha">Trekking in Baringo</h4>
                <p class="park-content">Ol Kokwe Island in the middle of the lake is perfect for exploring on foot.
                    There is good birding, and views across the lake to surrounding mountain ranges. There is a Njemps
                    Fishing village where you can visit and at the far north of the island, a series of bubbling hot
                    springs..</p>

                <hr class="makerHr">
                <h4 id="bikenaivasha">Trekking, Lake Elementaita</h4>
                <p class="park-content">Walking around the lake in the morning or afternoon is great for birding. There
                    is always a high concentration of flamingo on the shores, with Fish Eagles and other birds in the
                    forests. Zebra, Giraffe, Gazelle and other plains game are often seen here..</p>

                <hr class="makerHr">
                <h4 id="bikenaivasha">Menengai Crater Trek</h4>
                <p class="park-content">An excellent hike in this area is to the rim of Menengai Crater, high over
                    Nakuru town. This huge volcanic crater is 12km across and 500m deep. It is possible to climb up to
                    the craters edge (2272m) with spectacular views from the top. The hike should take about 6 hours to
                    the crater and back from Nakuru..</p>

                <hr class="makerHr">
                <h4 id="bikenaivasha">Hiking Mount Longonot</h4>
                <p class="park-content">The 2100m high Mt Longonot is an enjoyable way to spend a day. The views from
                    the top across to Naivasha and the Aberdares are sensational, and the views of the crater within the
                    mountain even more breathtaking. The climb up is relatively easy if you take it slowly, and the
                    average climber can reach the top in an hour and a half, following a well defined path. Take plenty
                    of water with you. There are rest stops with tables on the way. Once at the top, a further hour can
                    be spent walking around the crater rim, with excellent views the entire way. There is also a steep
                    path down to the crater floor. Ranger guides are available at the Park Gate. Longonot is an easy
                    day’s trek, but for the adventurous, the crater presents interesting possibilities for abseiling.
                    Abseillers would need their own equipment and the assistance of a locally skilled guide..</p>
