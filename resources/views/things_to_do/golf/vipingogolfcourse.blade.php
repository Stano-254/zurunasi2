                <p class="park-content">Vipingo Ridge Golf Resort on the North Cost of Mombasa lies in the centre of a
                    2,500 acre former sisal estate. The property rises from just above sea level to a 140 metre high
                    ridge before falling off again to the scenic lake and game conservation area to the west of the
                    site.</p>
                <p class="park-content">The two golf courses at Vipingo Ridge are the first in East Africa to be built
                    to a truly international standard, with the world renowned USGA specification being used for all
                    aspects of the course..</p>

                <p class="park-content">The large and undulating greens at Vipingo Ridge are cultivated with fine
                    Bermuda grasses to guarantee fast and true putting surfaces...</p>
                <p class="park-content"> A fully automated irrigation system and a large inventory of new green-keeping
                    equipment ensure that the playing surfaces are maintained in pristine condition all year round..</p>
                <p class="park-content">Kenya’s world famous wildlife is never far away. A round of golf in Kenya can
                    often be a nature walk in itself, with a remarkable profusion of bird life and wildlife surrounding
                    the greens..</p>
                <p class="park-content">You don’t have to move far from the green in Kenya to discover a world of travel
                    opportunities. Kenya offers endless choice of activities suited for adventure or relaxation.</p>
                <p class="park-content">No matter how you want to spend your time off the course, you’ll find plenty of
                    options. Next time you are on a Kenya Safari, remember to pack your golf clubs</p>
