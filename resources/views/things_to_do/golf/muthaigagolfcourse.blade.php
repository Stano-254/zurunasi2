                    (220 yards), further on the left. The original nine holes were laid out at Muthaiga in 1913 and the
                    club foundation stone was laid in 1912 and the golf course become an amenity for the club members
                    and their friends.</p>

                    flowering bushes not only come into play on almost every hole, but also make this course one of the
                    prettiest to play. By 1926 the course was later extended to eighteen holes to accommodate the
                    growing membership.</p>

                <p class="park-content"> The club decided to take on Associate members who later formed the Associate
                    Members clubhouse which then became the clubhouse for the entire golfing section in 1921. The Golf
                    Clubs Cadre of proficient caddies is at your disposal. Most of these men are sufficiently
                    low-handicapped players themselves that their advice is well heeded on questionable distances and

                <p class="park-content"> Muthaiga is still noted for it’s very fine greens which gives the club a
                    beautiful layout and one that has may challenges in store for both the regular and the visiting
