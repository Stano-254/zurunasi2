                <p class="park-content">The Nyali Golf and Country Club is the only eighteen-hole golf course on the
                    north Coast. Monty Lowry was the golfer behind the courseâ€™s design.</p>
                <p class="park-content">This particular course is said to be challenging as the winds influence playing
                    conditions. The club also prides in its restaurant notably the II Duetto which specializes in
                    Italian cuisine</p>

                <p class="park-content">its situated in the up-market residential suburb of Nyali which lies north of
                    the creek that separates Mombasa island from North Coast, the 18-hole course here at the Nyali Golf
                    and Country club is laid out over a 150-acre site that was once part of an estate that processed
                    sisal for rope and wine production.
                </p>
                <p class="park-content">When the market declined for sisal in the 1940s, the owner split the land up
                    into housing plots, creating a 9-hole course as a recreational amenity for residents in 1958. when
                    Nyali became a members' club in 1974, its name was changed to Nyali Golf and Country club and,
                    within six years, the course had been extended to a full 18-hole layout. </p>
                <p class="park-content">Polana grass from Mozambique was used in the construction of all the greens at
                    Nyali and it is still used today with grown into a club nursery. Wild animals still roam around and
                    occassional velvet monkeys 'the club's mascot as displayed on its logo' can still be spotted during
                    a round. </p>
                <p class="park-content">thanks to a top of the range irrigation system, dry spells never change the
                    condition of this gently rolling course anything other lush, with flowering trees like the
                    Madagascar Flame Tree bordering many of the east can influence a game here so be prepered for
                    ocassional days of links-link conditions at Nyali</p>
