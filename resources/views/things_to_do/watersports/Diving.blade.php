                <p class="park-title"> Kenya is becoming increasingly popular as a dive destination. Kenya has another
                    great wilderness area hid beneath the surface of the Indian Ocean, a wilderness just as rich,
                    diverse and ripe for exploration as any of our game parks. The calm turquoise waters of our beaches
                    lie in the protective shelter of
                    reef after reef, home to a myriad bounty of sea life.
                    Plunge below the surface and you will discover a new kind of safari- the world’s finest scuba
                    safari. Just as our plains are a sanctuary for vast herds of plains game, our reefs are home to huge
                    shoals of many species of fish, stalked by undersea predators as fascinating as our lions and
                    leopards. For those seeking out Kenya’s giant species- our elephant herds are matched by the
                    migratory pods of whales that pass by our outer reefs.</p>

                <h4 id="diani">Mtwapa and Barracuda Reef</h4>
                <p class="park-content">
                    A little further South towards Kilifi, there are good sites at Mtwapa and Barracuda Reef. The outer
                    edges here have large shoals of angel and butterfly fish, and there have been
                    occasional sighting of the world’s largest shark- the spectacular Whale Shark- in these waters.</p>
                <p class="park-content">The trip normally starts with a 3 km easy class of II and III, giving you an
                    opportunity to practiThe adventurous diver will not want to miss diving at the Vuma Caves near
                    Kilifi Creek. The caves are about 20 metres beneath the surface on the face of some seaside cliffs.
                    The open sea around the entrance is a good place to spot dolphins, while the interior of the caves
                    is a refuge for eels, some very large grouper and barracuda. After exploring the caves,
                    divers exit through a 10 metre chimney to emerge through a hole in the reef above.</p>

                <h4 id="watama">Watamu Marine National Park</h4>
                <p class="park-content"> iThe coast North of Mombasa has several world class dive sites. Some of the
                    best sites are in the Watamu Marine National Park- a
                    well protected and managed area. The reef here is close to shore, meaning easily accessible shallow
                    coral gardens that are ideal for learners and snorkellers.</p>
                <p class="park-content">The outer reef has some fine drop offs, with sheer walls, and large brain corals
                    attracting consistently abundant sea life. Dives on the central Turtle Reef average at around 10-15
                    meters, with high spiking coral heads attracting large shoals of colourful parrot and surgeon fish.
                    You can occasionally sight a few white-tip reef sharks that are in residence on the reef</p>

                <h4 id="bikenaivasha">Kisite Mpunguti Marine Reserve </h4>
                <p class="park-content"> South of Mombasa, there are dive sites ranged along the coast from Tiwi south
                    to Shimoni. Some of the best sites are centred around Kisiite Mpunguti Marine Reserve. This area is
                    your best chance to sight some of the largest Manta Rays on the East African coast
                </p>
                <p class="park-content">For experienced divers, the best option here is Nyulli Reef. This is a good deep
                    dive with strong tidal currents which allow drifts through spectacular coral, snapper, barracuda,
                    rare zebra sharks and massive Napoleon wrasse. A much easier dive is Kisite Point. There is plenty
                    of large, tame shoals to be found here, with average dive depth of around 12 metres. Divers at
                    Kisite often encounter hawksbill turtles and bottlenose dolphins.</p>
