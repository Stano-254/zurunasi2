                <h4 id="diani">White Water Rafting in Sagana</h4>
                <p class="park-content">Just 95kms out of Nairobi, the Tana River has some excellent rapids.
                    If you recently purchased the best inflatable kayak or raft, then this river is going to be such a
                    good idea. A rafting trip on the river offers a combination of 16 kms of White Water (up to Class
                    V in season) and 12 km of clear river ideal for calm drifts through spectacular scenery. The rafting
                    on this stretch of river is ideal for first time rafters, and is an excellent taster for Kenya’s
                    other
                    white water adventures. The drifts are a good opportunity for bird watching, and over 100 species
                    have
                    been recorded along the riverbanks. A days rafting in Sagana includes a full BBQ lunch. If you are
                    looking for an adventurous and relaxing day trip out of Nairobi, this is the perfect option.</p>
                <p class="park-content">The trip normally starts with a 3 km easy class of II and III, giving you an
                    opportunity to practice and learn the skills of paddling. A 6 km section is a bit calmer and here
                    you can cool
                    off as you enjoy swimming in warm waters. Finally, you are now ready to take the final stretches
                    with class IV and
                    V rapids. There are numerous small rapids and later 15 minutes float bringing you safely back to
                    Savage Wilderness Camp.</p>
