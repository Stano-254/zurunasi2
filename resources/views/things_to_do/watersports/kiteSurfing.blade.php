                <p class="park-title"> Kenya is a wonderful beach destination.
                    The white-sand beaches, clear turquoise water of the Indian Ocean and the scenic palm trees
                    make for a wonderful kitesurfing experience. It’s the best way to escape your monotonous daily
                    routine and have an adventure of a lifetime! Moreover, Kenya is affordable and offers excellent
                    kitesurfing schools! Moreover, the Kenyan coast is mostly near the equator,
                    so the winds there are consistently strong throughout the year and the weather doesn’t
                    fluctuate a lot either!.</p>
