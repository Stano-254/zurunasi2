                <p class="park-content">Amboseli lies immediately north-west of Mount Kilimanjaro, on the border with
                    Tanzania. The Park covers 392 square km, and forms part of the much larger 3,000 square km Amboseli
                    ecosystem.</p>
                <p class="park-content">Large concentrations of wildlife occur here in the dry season, making Amboseli a
                    popular tourist destination. It is surrounded by six communally owned group ranches.</p>
                <p class="park-content">The National Park embodies five main wildlife habitats (open plains, acacia
                    woodland, rocky thorn bush country, swamps and marshland) and covers part of a Pleistocene lake
                    basin, now dry.</p>
                <p class="park-content">Amboseli is famous for its big game and its great scenic beauty – and the
                    landscape is dominated by the towering Mount Kilimanjaro</p>
                <p class="park-content"><strong>Major Attractions:</strong> Mount Kilimanjaro; Observation Hill which
                    allows an overall view of the whole park especially the swamps and elephants; Swamp below
                    observation hill hosts many elephants, buffaloes, hippos and a variety of water fowl like pelican;
                    Egyptian goose; contemporary Maasai culture and indigenous lifestyle; herds of elephants.</p>
                <p class="park-content"><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Amboseli has over 80 different mammals to be found
                    ranging from the tiny (and rarely seen) spectacled elephant shrew to the huge bulk of the African
                    elephant. Few visitors will go home without superb elephant pictures with Kilimanjaro as a backdrop.
                    There are over 400 bird species.</p>
                <p class="park-content">Getting there – By Road: The main road into the park is from Nairobi via Namanga
                    (240 km) on the Nairobi-Arusha Road, via Meshanani Gate. The road is tarmaced up to Namanga but is
                    murram from Namanga to Meshanani Gate (75km).</p>
